I agree to process all producer election transactions that occur in blocks I create, to sign all objectively valid blocks I create that contain election transactions, and to sign all pre-confirmations and confirmations necessary to facilitate transfer of control to the next set of producers as determined by the system contract.\n\nI hereby acknowledge that more than two-thirds of the active block producers may vote to disqualify {{producer}} in the event {{producer}} is unable to produce blocks or is unable to be reached, according to criteria agreed to among block producers.\n\nIf {{producer}} qualifies for and chooses to collect compensation due to votes received, {{producer}} will provide a public endpoint allowing at least 100 peers to maintain synchronization with the blockchain and/or submit transactions to be included. {{producer}} shall maintain at least one validating node with full state and signature checking and shall report any objectively invalid blocks produced by the active block producers. Reporting shall be via a method to be agreed to among block producers, said method and reports to be made public.\n\nThe community agrees to allow {{producer}} to authenticate peers as necessary to prevent abuse and denial of service attacks; however, {{producer}} agrees not to discriminate against non-abusive peers.\n\nI agree to process transactions on a FIFO (first in, first out) best-effort basis and to honestly bill transactions for measured execution time.\n\nI {{producer}} agree not to manipulate the contents of blocks in order to derive profit from: the order in which transactions are included, or the hash of the block that is produced.\n\nI, {{producer}}, hereby agree to disclose and attest under penalty of perjury all ultimate beneficial owners of my business entity who own more than 10% and all direct shareholders.\n\nI, {{producer}}, hereby agree to cooperate with other block producers to carry out our respective and mutual obligations under this agreement, including but not limited to maintaining network stability and a valid blockchain.\n\nI, {{producer}}, agree to maintain a website hosted at {{url}} which contains up-to-date information on all disclosures required by this contract.\n\nI, {{producer}}, agree to set the location value of {{location}} such that {{producer}} is scheduled with minimal latency between my previous and next peer.\n\nI, {{producer}}, agree to maintain time synchronization within 10 ms of global atomic clock time, using a method agreed to among block producers.\n\nI, {{producer}}, agree not to produce blocks before my scheduled time unless I have received all blocks produced by the prior block producer.\n\nI, {{producer}}, agree not to publish blocks with timestamps more than 500ms in the future unless the prior block is more than 75% full by either NET or CPU bandwidth metrics.\n\nI, {{producer}}, agree not to set the RAM supply to more RAM than my nodes contain and to resign if I am unable to provide the RAM approved by more than two-thirds of active block producers, as shown in the system parameters.",
